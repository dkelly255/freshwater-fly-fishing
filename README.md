## Testing

- I also used DevTools to confirm that the project is responsive, functional and aesthetically pleasing on all standard screen sizes 
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, about section, and contact pages are all readable & easy to understand
- Testing has also been completed to confirm that the contact form works correctly, that required fields are specified, and that the email field will only accept an email - and also that the submit button works

### HTML
- The W3C Validator was used to confirm that all HTML code was error free & functioned as expected

### Resolved Bugs
- Initially there were unexplained hypens present between my social media linksin my footer - this was due to spaces being present in my anchor element tags in the footer which I resolved
- The Text overlay on the Home Page Main Image was not travelling correctly with responsive screen sizes - this was due to a missing absolute position attribute in the CSS code and was resolved by adding the required attribute

### Unresolved Bugs
- No unfixed bugs were present in the finalised website code

## Deployment
- The site was deployed to Github pages. The steps to display are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
    - The link will then be provided to the completed website

## Credits

### Content

- I used the lessons learned during the Code Institute [Love Running](https://github.com/dkelly255/love-running) project to help with the structure for Freshwater Fishing
- In several locations throughout the HTML & CSS codes I have included credits in the comments where code from [Love Running](https://github.com/dkelly255/love-running) has been used and adapted for this website
- For example - The code to make the social media links for the footer was initially taken from the Code Institute [Love Running](https://github.com/dkelly255/love-running) project, and was updated to fit the look & feel of Freshwater Fly Fishing
- The code for the responsive grid on the locations page was taken from The Net Ninja's CSS grid tutorial, and adapted to display two grids to contain rivers & lakes, images, and descriptions - this is also clearly labelled in the CSS & HTML comments
